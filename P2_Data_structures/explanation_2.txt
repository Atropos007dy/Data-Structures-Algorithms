1. Use recursion to deal with the problem since no one knows the depth of the subdirectories. 

2. The basic idea is:
(1) get all the files or directories under current path
(2) if current file is a file and it has the suffix we want to find, add to the results list
(3) if current file is a directory, find files under the new director, then extend the results.
(4) time complexity: O(n), n depends on the number of subdirectories under the folder.
(5) space complexity: O(n),  n is the number of files.
