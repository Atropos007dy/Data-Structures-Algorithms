Time Complexity Analysis:

-Task 0: 
 O(1),just using index to get the element, so constant time complexity
-Task 1: 
 O(M+N), where M is the number of call records, N is the number of text records.
-Task 2: 
 O(N), where N is the number of call records. Count the total time spend on phone is O(N),find the maximum value is O(N).
-Task 3: 
 Counting the number of calls by Bangalore is O(N).
 Sorting aera codes is O(NlogN).
 Calculating percentage is O(1).
 So total is O(NlogN).
-Task 4: 
 Finding candidates is O(M+N), where M is the number of call records, N is the number of text records.
 Sorting worst case is O(Mlog(M)), where M is the number of call records.
