1. This problem is similar to problem 2, we need to use recursion to detect user in subgroups.

2. The basic idea is:
(1) check if the user is under current group, if yes, return True
(2) if the user is not under current group, check if the user is under the subgroup
(3) time complexity: O(n), n depends on the number of subgroups and users under current group.
(4) space complexity: O(1)
