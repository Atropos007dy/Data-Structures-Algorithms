The basic idea is to use a linked list to construct the blockchain.
1.Each block is like a node in the linked list.
2.Inorder to insert new block in O(1), we need to use "self.tail" to record the last block and append it after the tail.
3. Space complexity is O(n), n is the number of blocks in the blockchain.
