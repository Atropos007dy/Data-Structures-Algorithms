The basic idea is:
1. For union function, use a set to store all unique values seen in the both list1 and list2.
2. For intersection function, use 2 sets to store unique values seen in list1 and list2 separately, the check if values in set1 also exists in set2.

Time and space complexity:
1. union:
- time: O(M+N), M,N are the lengths of list1 and list2
- Space: O(M+N), M,N are the lengths of list1 and list2, in the worst case, there are no intersection between list1 and list2
2. intersection: 
- time: O(M+N): M,N are the lengths of list1 and list2
- space: O(N): N is the length of shorter list. The worst case is when list1 and list2 are the same.
